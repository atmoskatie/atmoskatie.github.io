**Hi everyone! My name is Katie Chan hehe!** <img align="right" src="/assets/IMG/cloud.png">

For this project, you will be applying your skills to train a machine learning model using real-world data, then publishing a report on your own website.

### Dataset
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityakadiwal/water-potability

### Report

Your report should be **delivered via your website**. Submit a link to your website on BruinLearn so that your instructor can browse it to find your report. 

To make this simple, you can write the report using a word processor or Latex, then export it as a .pdf file and upload it to the `assets` directory. You can then link to it [like so](/assets/project_demo.pdf). However, you can also type the report directly onto the website using another markdown page - [here is](/project.md) a template for that.
